<p>Welcome to Next Thing Co. PocketC.H.I.P. documentation.</p>

<p>When we made C.H.I.P., the $9 computer, many people thought it came with a screen and keyboard. At the time it did not, but it made us think, what if we did build a product with a screen and keyboard that used C.H.I.P.. We did, it&rsquo;s PocketC.H.I.P..</p>

          <h1 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h1>

<p>This section explains how to turn on and charge PocketC.H.I.P., plus quickly configure WiFi. There’s a lot more you can do with PocketC.H.I.P. too, so check out the other sections of this document for further instructions.</p>

<p><img alt="images/charge.png" src="images/charge.png" /></p>

<p>Turn on PocketC.H.I.P. by holding down the Home/Power button at the bottom, middle of the keyboard, for TKTK seconds. </p>

<p><img alt="images/pwron.png" src="images/pwron.png" /></p>

<p>PocketC.H.I.P. will take a moment to start, but while it does it shows TKTK. Once it is done loading, you will see a screen with 6  icons. This is the HOME screen. </p>

<p><img alt="images/touchscreen.png" src="images/touchscreen.png" /></p>

<p>Use a finger or stylus to tap on the application you want to use. Press gently enough to make contact with the screen. There’s no need to </p>

<p><strong><em>ANNOTATED IMAGE of HOME screen w/ numbers calling out each icon</em></strong></p>

<p>Tap the down arrow at the bottom center of the screen to see more applications. For more on specific applications, see the apps section of this document.</p>

<p>While using  an application, press the HOME/Power button to return to the HOME screen.</p>

<h2 id="wifi-setup">WiFi Setup</h2>

<p>From the HOME screen, tap the WiFi icon in the top left corner to access the Settings screen. Then slide the switch next to the WiFi icon to the right to turn the wifi on. Tap the button to the right of the Wifi switch to select your network.</p>

<p>Then tap on the network you want to join. If needed slide your finger up and down on the list to scroll.</p>

<p>When prompted, enter the network password in the text field, then touch the [Connect] button. It may take a few seconds to connect.
Troubleshooting</p>

<p>If PocketC.H.I.P. becomes unresponsive, hold down the Home/Power button for 8 seconds. This will terminate the battery power to PocketC.H.I.P. causing a hard-shutdown. Only use this shutdown method if no other shutdown methods work.</p>

<p>Your PocketC.H.I.P. comes with TK applications on the home screen.</p>

<h1 id="pico-8">Pico-8</h1>

<p>Pico-8 is a virtual console that allows you to run games created by members of the Pico-8 community, modify their games, or create games of your own. This means that opening Pico-8 is like starting up a tiny computer inside your computer. Pico-8 runs on “carts” (files that act like old video game cartridges). There are two main ways to find and play carts in Pico-8: Splore mode and standard mode.
Splore mode
To reach splore mode from the command line, type ‘splore’. This launches an explorer that browses the games currently in the system. If PocketCHIP is connected to the internet, the explorer can also be used to browse and download games from the Pico-8 community. Navigate the menus using the arrow keys, and press enter to select a game.</p>

<h2 id="standard-mode">Standard Mode</h2>

<p>Pico-8’s standard mode is a command line interface. Possible commands are listed below
    Help    lists the available commands
dir        list the contents of the current directory
cd [directory name]   change to the desired directory
cd ..      go up a directory
cd /       change back to top directory (on pico-8&rsquo;s virtual drive)
mkdir      make a new directory
folder     open the current directory in the host operating system&rsquo;s file browser
load [name of game]  load a game from the current directory (this is like putting a cartridge into the console)
run     plays the cart that is currently loaded
save [file name]    saves the currently loaded cart with the given name (this is used when you’ve made changes to the game’s code, graphics, or music)</p>

<p>For more great games, look no further than the Pico-8 community. Game cart files are stored in Pico-8’s bulletin board system and can be downloaded and saved to the Pico-8 folder.</p>

<h2 id="make-games-with-pico-8">Make Games (with Pico-8)</h2>

<p>Gamers get ready to become game developers. With the fantasy console Pico8 you play, program, and compose music all in one app. </p>

<p>Image describing the different Pico-8 modes: see fan zine issue 1</p>

<p>PICO-8 is a single application with TK different modes. It starts in command mode, where you can interact with files (load, save, run). Command mode is a lot like a the terminal application on PocketC.H.I.P., except it has far few commands.</p>

<p>Pico-8 displays capital letters for all text, but you don’t have to. Just type lowercase, Pico-8 will handle the rest.</p>

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>

<p>Type in the following italicized text and press the return button. 
load cartname
run cartname</p>

<p>Note: You must load a cartridge before you can use the run command. </p>

<h2 id="code-editor">Code Editor</h2>

<p>Access the code editor from the command mode by press ESC. If you are in the middle of a game you’ll need to hit ESC twice. Some other helpful shortcuts are:</p>

<p>Hold shift to select multiple characters or lines (or click and drag with mouse)</p>

<ul>
<li>CTRL-X, C, V to cut copy or paste selection</li>
<li>CTRL-Z, Y to undo, redo</li>
<li>CTRL-F, G to search for text, repeat search</li>
<li>ALT-UP, DOWN to navigate to the previous, next function</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: if you’re working on a complex game, you may find it easier to open the cart outside of Pico-8 in a text editor. Check out TKTK for an example.</p>

<p>The code editor is not the only editor in Pico-8. While you’re in the code editor, look at the icons across the top of the screen. These are tappable Access the other editors by clicking on the icons in the upper right hand corner of the editor. </p>

<p><strong><em>Image of the editor icons highlighted</em></strong></p>

<h2 id="sprite-editor">Sprite Editor</h2>

<p><strong><em>Image of the sprite editor button</em></strong> </p>

<p><strong><em>Image of sprite editor screen</em></strong>
Use the sprite editor to create the artwork that make up tiles, characters, or other elements of the game. The navigator at the bottom of the sprite editor screen shows a  8x8 pixel box that is displayed in the sprite sheet window, but it is possible to use freeform tools (pan, select) to edit larger areas. </p>

<p>Use the following tools to edit sprites:</p>

<h3 id="draw-tool">Draw Tool</h3>

<p>Click on the desired color and then click in the editor window to apply the color to each pixel
Hold LCONTROL and click on a pixel to replace all of the same-colored pixels in the window with the selected color</p>

<h3 id="stamp-tool">Stamp Tool</h3>

<p>Select an area of the sprite sheet that you want to copy using the select tool
Select the stamp tool and click the location where you want the copied pixels to be pasted
Hold LCONTROL to stamp with transparency (this pastes all of the non-black pixels in the selection)</p>

<h3 id="select-tool-shortcut-lshift-or-s">Select Tool // shortcut: LSHIFT or S</h3>

<p>Click and drag with the select tool to highlight an area of the sprite sheet
Enter or click to select none
* Pan Tool // shortcut: space
* Click and drag to move around the sprite sheet
* Fill Tool
Fill an area with the selected color
If you have selected an area of the sprite sheet, the fill will be limited to the selected area
If no selection is active, the fill will be limited to the area in the editor window
Map Editor
The tools for the map editor work similarly to those in the sprite editor. However, rather than choosing colors and drawing directly on the map sheet, select a sprite and use the draw or fill tool to place sprites into the map sheet. </p>

<h2 id="sound-effects-editor">Sound Effects Editor</h2>

<p>Pico-8’s sound editor has two view modes: graph view and tracker view. Switch between modes by clicking on the graph and tracker buttons in the upper-left corner of the sound editor.</p>

<p>In both views, the number in the top left, under the view selector is the sound effect number. Pico-8 can handle 64 different effects. </p>

<p>Change the speed of the sound by clicking on the number in the box labelled SPD. Left clicking increases the value and right clicking decreases the value. The SPD value describes the duration of each note, so the higher the value, the slower the sound will play.</p>

<p>The LOOP values define the start and end points of a section of the sound effect that repeats. </p>

<p>Select from the 8 available instruments by clicking on the gray waveform boxes below the SPD and LOOP fields. </p>

<p>Press the spacebar to play/stop the current sound effect.</p>

<p>Graph mode
In graph mode, choose an instrument and then click and drag to “draw” the sound across the pitch window from left to right. Drawing higher in the window creates a sound with a higher pitch. To adjust the volume of each note, raise or lower the sliders in the volume window at the bottom of the graph mode screen.</p>

<h3 id="tracker-mode">Tracker mode</h3>

<p>In the tracker mode, each line of 6 dots represents a note. Each dot represents an aspect of the notes. In order (from left to right) they are:</p>

<p>Frequency (first 2 dots)
Denoted by the letter of the musical pitch 
To input the pitches, use the q2w3er5t6y7ui keys like a piano
Q is a ‘C’ note, W is a ‘D’ note
The number keys are the sharps and flats (like the black keys on a piano)
Octave
For each note, choose octave 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the OCT field at the top, or type the corresponding number
1 is the lowest octave and 4 is highest
Instrument
Choose one of the instruments in the gray waveform boxes or type the corresponding number (0 through 7)
Volume
Choose volume level in the VOL field or type the corresponding number (0 through 7)
Effect
Choose an effect from the boxes under the instruments or type the corresponding number (0 through 7)
The 8 effects are
0 none 
1 slide 
2 vibrato 
3 drop 
4 fade in 
5 fade out 
6 fast arpeggio 
7 slow arpeggio
Music Editor
To combine the sound effects to make music, the music editor allows up to four effects at a time. Click on the boxes above each column to activate the track and choose which effects will be included in each song pattern. </p>

<p>Patterns can be set to move to the next pattern, repeat the current pattern, or stop when finished with the arrow and stop icons on the upper right. </p>

<p>Pico-8 can hold up to 64 song patterns.</p>
